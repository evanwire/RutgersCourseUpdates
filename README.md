RutgersCourseUpdates
=======

A tool to access any new assignments or announcements that have been posted on Canvas or Sakai, the two course management sites Rutgers uses.

I am developing this because I hate having so many tabs open on Chrome just to keep track of my course updates.

*Make sure that, if you clone this repo, you rename the config_template.json file to just "config.json"*

### TOTO

* Add functionality to connnect to canvas
* Create a controller object to multithread the calls to Canvas and Sakai
* Figure out a way to display all of the information in an aesthetically pleasing manner (i.e. not just a write to stdout)

### Sakai Documentation

**ALL** of the data, endpoints and documentation can be found @ https://trunk-mysql.nightly.sakaiproject.org/direct/describe. 


*Note that this would work for other schools, not just rutgers. You would just have to alter the link in the config_template.json file to match your school's base url*
